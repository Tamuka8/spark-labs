# MLlib Labs 

* Recommendations: [Recommendatinos](recs/README.md)
* K-Means Clustering: [K-Means Clustering](kmeans/README.md)
* Classification: [Classification](classification/README.md)

## Note: 

These labs are not actively maintained. Most likely, the
trainer will want to use as much materials from the separate
Machine Learning course as the trainer will see fit for the particular class.

(This is because Machine Learning has progressed and deserves its own course.
Many courses, in fact.)
