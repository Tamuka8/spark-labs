RDD Operations
========
In this lab, we are going to do operations on two RDDs

Problem:
User1 attends meetups  m1, m2 and m3.
User2 attends meetups  m2, m3, m4  and m5

Q1 : find meetups common to both users

Q2 : Find meetups attened by either user1 or user2

Q3 : Recommending meetups to user.
user1 and user2 has a couple of meetups in common.  Let's use to this to recommend meetups to both users.
  meetups recommended for user1 : m4 & m5
  meetups recommended for user2 : m1

=============

Hints :

- start spark shell

- create data sets using parallelize() method
  scala :
    val u1 = sc.parallelize(List("m1", "m2", "m3"))

  python
    u1 = sc.parallelize(["m1", "m2", "m3"])


- use the following operations in RDDs
    union, intersection,  distinct,  subtract
