KMeans Lab

In this lab we discuss how to use kmeans clustering in Spark.

run this with:

$ spark-shell -i kmeans_mtcars.scala

Check out the final results of the groupedClusters.  Does the clustering make sense?  Perhaps
we have too few clusters.

Try experimenting with 3 clusters instead of two.  Rerun the results and see what you get.
